# Spatial Inequality Analysis


## Introduction

At the time this is being written, the topic of inequality is at the top of
agenda of policy makers and is drawing considerable attention in academic
circles. This is due to historic levels of inequality across the globe. Much of the focus has been on *interpersonal income inequality*,
yet there is a growing recognition that the question of *interregional income
inequality* requires further attention as the growing gaps between poor and rich
regions have been identified as key drivers of political polarization in
developing and developed countries [1].

Indeed, while the two literatures, personal and regional inequality, are
related, they have developed in a largely parallel fashion with limited
cross-fertilization. In this notebook, we examine how a spatially explicit focus
can provide insights on inequality and its dynamics. We also show the lineage of
regional inequality analysis to make explicit the linkage between it and the
older literature on personal inequality analysis.

We begin with an introduction to classic methods for interpersonal income
inequality analysis and how they have been adopted to the question of regional
inequalities. These include a number of graphical tools along side familiar
indices of inequality. As we discuss more fully, the use of these classical
methods in spatially referenced data, while useful in providing insights on some
of the aspects of spatial inequality, fails to fully capture the nature of
geographical disparities and their dynamics. Thus, we next move to spatially
explicit measures for regional inequality analysis. The notebook closes with
some recent extensions of some classical measures to more fully examine the
spatial dimensions of regional inequality dynamics.

## Global Inequality
We begin our examination of inequality by focusing on several global measures. Here, global means the measure is concerned with the overall, or a-spatial, nature of inequality. Several classic measures of inequality are available for this purpose.

In general terms, measures of inequality focus on the dispersion present in an income distribution. In the case of regional, or spatial, inequality the distributions are defined on average or per-capita incomes for a spatial unit, such as a county, census tract, or region. For the US counties, we can visualize the distribution of per capita incomes for the first year in the sample as follows:


To get a sense for the value distribution for per capita income, we can first discretize the distribution:
<!-- #endregion -->

```python ein.hycell=false ein.tags="worksheet-0" jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false} slideshow={"slide_type": "-"}
import seaborn  as sns
sns.set()
sns.distplot(pci_df['1969'])

```


The long right tail is a prominent feature of the distribution, and is common in the study of incomes. A key point to keep in mind here is that the unit of measurement in this data is a spatial aggregate - a county. By contrast, in the wider inequality literature the observational unit is typically a household or individual. In the latter distributions, the degree of skewness is often more pronounced, and this is because the regional distributions are based on averages obtained from the individual distributions.


The density is a powerful summary device that captures the overall morphology of the *value* distribution. At the same time, the density is silent on the underlying *spatial distribution* of county incomes. We can look at this second view of the distribution using a choropleth map:

```python ein.hycell=false ein.tags="worksheet-0" jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false} slideshow={"slide_type": "-"}
from pysal.viz import mapclassify
pci_1969 = pci_df['1969']
```

```python ein.hycell=false ein.tags="worksheet-0" jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false} slideshow={"slide_type": "-"}
q5_1969 = mapclassify.Quantiles(pci_df['1969'])

```
```python ein.hycell=false ein.tags="worksheet-0" jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false} slideshow={"slide_type": "-"}
_= pci_df.plot(column='1969', scheme='Quantiles', legend=True,
                 edgecolor='none',
             legend_kwds={'loc': 'lower right',
                         'bbox_to_anchor':(1.5, 0.0)}, figsize=(12, 12))
```

The choropleth and the kernel density provide different visual depictions of the distribution of county incomes. These are useful for developing an understanding of the overall  To gain more specific insights on the level of inequality in the distribution, we turn to a number of inequality indices.


### 20:20 Ratio

One commonly used measure of inequality in a distribution is the so called 20:20 ratio, which is defined as the ratio of the incomes at the 80th percentile over that at the 20th percentile: 
<!-- #endregion -->
```python ein.hycell=false ein.tags="worksheet-0" jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false} slideshow={"slide_type": "-"}
q5_1969.bins
```


```python ein.hycell=false ein.tags="worksheet-0" jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false} slideshow={"slide_type": "-"}
i_20_20 = q5_1969.bins[-2]/q5_1969.bins[0]
i_20_20
```
<!-- #region {"ein.tags": "worksheet-0", "slideshow": {"slide_type": "-"}} -->
In 1969 the richest 20% of the counties had an income that was 1.5 times the poorest 20% of the counties. The 20:20 ratio has the advantage of being robust to outliers at the top and the bottom of the distribution. 

We can examine the dynamics of this global inequality measure by creating a simple function to apply to all years in our time series:
<!-- #endregion -->

```python ein.hycell=false ein.tags="worksheet-0" jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false} slideshow={"slide_type": "-"}
def ineq_2020(values):
    q5 = mapclassify.Quantiles(values)
    return q5.bins[-2]/q5.bins[0]
    
    
```

```python ein.hycell=false ein.tags="worksheet-0" jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false} slideshow={"slide_type": "-"}
years = list(range(1969, 2018))
i_20_20_all = numpy.array([ ineq_2020(pci_df[str(year)]) for year in years])
_ = plt.plot(years, i_20_20_all)
_ = plt.ylabel("20:20 ratio")
_ = plt.xlabel("Year")


```
<!-- #region {"ein.tags": "worksheet-0", "slideshow": {"slide_type": "-"}} -->
The ratio has a U-shaped pattern over time, bottoming out around 1994 after a long secular decline in the early period. Post 1994, however, the trend is one of increasing inequality up until 2013 where there is a turn towards lower income inequality between the counties.

<!-- #region {"ein.tags": "worksheet-0", "slideshow": {"slide_type": "-"}} -->
For other classic measures of inequality, we will use the `inequality` package from `pysal`:
<!-- #endregion -->

```python ein.hycell=false ein.tags="worksheet-0" jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false} slideshow={"slide_type": "-"}
from pysal.explore import inequality
```

<!-- #region {"ein.tags": "worksheet-0", "slideshow": {"slide_type": "-"}} -->
### Gini Index

The Gini index can be derived in a number of ways. Visually, the Gini is defined as the ratio of the area between
the line of equality and the Lorenze curve over the area below the line of equality, both of which are defined on a a two-dimensional space with population
percentiles on the x-axis and cumulative income on the vertical axis.

We can construct each of these as follows:

<!-- #endregion -->

```python
y = pci_df.sort_values(by=['1969'])['1969']
```

```python
Fy = (y / y.sum()).cumsum()
```

```python
import numpy as np
%matplotlib inline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

```python
n = y.shape[0]
Fn = np.arange(1, n+1)/n
```

```python
f, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(Fn,Fy)
ax.plot(Fn, Fn)
#plt.xlim(0, 1.0)
```
The blue line is the Lorenze curve, and the Gini is the area between it and the 45-degree line of equality, expressed as a ratio over the area under the line of equality.

To examine how inequality evolves over time, we can create a function for the Lorenze curve:

```python
def lorenz(y):
    y = np.sort(y)
    Fy = (y / y.sum()).cumsum()
    n = y.shape[0]
    Fn = np.arange(1, n+1)/n
    return Fy
```

```python
lorenz(y)
```
and then call this for each year in our sample:
```python
lorenz_curves = np.array([ lorenz(pci_df[str(year)]) for year in years])
```

```python
f, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(Fn,Fn)
for c in lorenz_curves:
    ax.plot(Fn, c)

```

The compression of the Lorenze curves makes it difficult to ascertain the temporal pattern in inequality. Focusing explicilty on the Gini coefficients may shed more light on this evolution:

```python ein.hycell=false ein.tags="worksheet-0" jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false} slideshow={"slide_type": "-"}
g69 = inequality.gini.Gini(pci_df['1969'].values)

```

```python ein.hycell=false ein.tags="worksheet-0" jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false} slideshow={"slide_type": "-"}
g69.g
```

```python ein.hycell=false ein.tags="worksheet-0" jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false} slideshow={"slide_type": "-"}
years = [str(y) for y in range(1969, 2018)]
ginis = numpy.array([inequality.gini.Gini(pci_df[year].values).g for year in years])
years = numpy.array([int(y) for y in years])
```

```python ein.hycell=false ein.tags="worksheet-0" jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false} slideshow={"slide_type": "-"}
gini_df = pandas.DataFrame(data = numpy.hstack([[years, ginis]]).T, columns=['Year', 'Gini'])
gini_df['Year'] = gini_df['Year'].astype(int)
gini_df.head()
```

```python ein.hycell=false ein.tags="worksheet-0" jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false} slideshow={"slide_type": "-"}
gini_df.index = pandas.to_datetime(gini_df['Year'], format="%Y")
gini_df = gini_df.drop(columns=["Year"])
```

```python ein.hycell=false ein.tags="worksheet-0" jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false} slideshow={"slide_type": "-"}
_ = gini_df.plot(y=["Gini"])
```

### Theil's index

A third commonly used measure of inequality is Theil's $T$ given as:
$$T = \sum_{i=1}^m \left( \frac{y_i}{\sum_{i=1}^m y_i} \ln \left[ m \frac{y_i}{\sum_{i=1}^m y_i}\right] \right)$$
where $y_i$ is per-capita income in area $i$ among $m$ areas. In PySAL, we can calculate this index each year as:

```python ein.hycell=false ein.tags="worksheet-0" jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false} slideshow={"slide_type": "-"}
gini_df['T'] = [inequality.theil.Theil(pci_df[str(y)]).T for y in years]
```

```python ein.hycell=false ein.tags="worksheet-0" jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false} slideshow={"slide_type": "-"}
#gini_df.plot(figsize=(15,4))
_ = gini_df.plot(subplots=True, figsize=(15,6))
#gini_df.plot(y=['Gini', 'T'], figsize=(15,4))
```

The time paths of the Gini and the Theil coefficients show striking
similarities, and, at first glance, this might suggest that the indices are
substitutes for one another. As we shall see below, however, each index has
properties that lend themselves to particular spatial extensions that provide
important complementarities.

## Personal versus Regional Income
There is a subtle but important distinction between the study of personal and
regional income inequality. To see this, we first need to express the
relationships between the two types of inequality. Consider a country composed
of $N$ individuals who are distributed over $m$ regions. Let $Y_l$ denote the
income of individual $l$. Total personal income in region $i$ is given as $Y_i =
\sum_{l \in i} Y_l$. Per-capita income in region $i$ is $y_i = \frac{Y_i}{N_i}$,
where $N_i$ is the number of individuals in region $i$.

At the national level,  the coefficient of variation as an index of  interpersonal income inequality would be:

$$CV_{nat} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{l=1}^N (Y_l - \bar{y})^2}{N}}$$

where $\bar{y}$ is national per-capita income. The key component here is the sum
of squares term, and unpacking this sheds light on personal versus regional
inequality question:


$$TSS = \sum_{l=1}^N (Y_l - \bar{y})^2$$

Focusing on an individual deviation: $\delta_l = Y_l - \bar{y}$, this is the contribution to inequality associated with individual $l$. We can break this into two components:

$$\delta_l = (Y_l - y_i) +  (y_i - \bar{y})$$

The first term is the difference between the individual's income and per-capita income in the individual's region of residence, while the second term is the difference between the region's per capita income and average national per capita income.

In regional studies, the intraregional personal income distribution is typically
not available. As a result, the assumption is often made that intraregional
personal inequality is zero. In other words, all individuals in the same region
have identical incomes. With this assumption in hand, the first term vanishes:
$Y_l -y_i = 0$, leading to: **FOOTNOTE:** It should also be noted that even at
the national scale, the analysis of interpersonal income inequality also relies
on aggregate data grouping individuals into income cohorts. See, for example,
Piketty, T. and E. Saez (2003) "Income inequality in the United States,
1913-1998", The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 118: 1-41.

$$
\begin{aligned}
TSS &= \sum_{l=1}^N (Y_l - \bar{y})^2 \\
    &= \sum_{l=1}^N \delta_l^2 \\
    &= \sum_{l=1}^N ((Y_l - y_i) +  (y_i - \bar{y}))^2 \\
    &= \sum_{l=1}^N (0 +  (y_i - \bar{y}))^2 \\
    &= \sum_{i=1}^m\sum_{l \in i}  (y_i - \bar{y})^2 \\
    &= \sum_{i=1}^m  [N_i(y_i - \bar{y})]^2
\end{aligned}
$$
This means that each individual in a region has an equal contribution to the
overall level of national interpersonal inequality, given by $(y_i - \bar{y})$,
while the region in question contributes $N_i(y_i - \bar{y})$. While it may seem
that the assumption of zero intraregional interepersonal income inequality is
overly restrictive, it serves to isolate the nature of interregional income
inequality. That is, inequality between places, rather than inequality between
people within those places. In essence, this strategy shifts the question up one
level in the spatial hierarchy by aggregating micro-level individual data to
areal units.



<!-- #region {"ein.tags": "worksheet-0", "slideshow": {"slide_type": "-"}} -->
## Spatial Inequality
<!-- #endregion -->
The analysis of regional income inequality is distinguished from the analysis of
national interpersonal income inequality in its focus on spatial units. As
regional incomes are embedded in geographical space, it is important to consider
the special nature of spatial data. In the regional inequality literature this
has been approaches in a number of ways.

<!-- #region {"ein.tags": "worksheet-0", "slideshow": {"slide_type": "-"}} -->
### Spatial Autocorrelation
To get some insights on the spatial properties of regional income data, we can
turn to global measures of spatial autocorrelation that we encountered in
chapter XX. We use a queen spatial weights matrix to calculate Moran's I for
each year in the sample.
<!-- #endregion -->

```python ein.hycell=false ein.tags="worksheet-0" jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false} slideshow={"slide_type": "-"}
wq = pysal.lib.weights.Queen.from_dataframe(pci_df)
```

```python ein.hycell=false ein.tags="worksheet-0" jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false} slideshow={"slide_type": "-"}
wq.n
```

```python ein.hycell=false ein.tags="worksheet-0" jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false} slideshow={"slide_type": "-"}
MI = [pysal.explore.esda.moran.Moran(pci_df[str(y)], wq) for y in years]
```

```python ein.hycell=false ein.tags="worksheet-0" jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false} slideshow={"slide_type": "-"}
res = np.array([ (mi.I, mi.p_sim) for mi in MI])
```
```python
res.shape
```

```python ein.hycell=false ein.tags="worksheet-0" jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false} slideshow={"slide_type": "-"}
res_df = gini_df
res_df['I'] = res[:,0]
res_df['I pvalue'] = res[:,1]
_ = res_df[["Gini", "T", "I", "I pvalue"]].plot(subplots=True, figsize=(15,6))
```
```python
res_df.columns
```

Several patterns emerge from the time series of Moran's I. First, the is a secular decline in the value of Moran's I. Second, despite this decline,  there is never a year in which the spatial autocorrelation is not statistically significant. In other words, there is a strong spatial structure in the distribution of regional incomes that needs to be accounted for when focusing on inequality questions.
<!-- #region {"ein.tags": "worksheet-0", "slideshow": {"slide_type": "-"}} -->

### Decompositional Approaches

A popular approach to the analysis of inequality is to group the observations into mutually exclusive and exhaustive subsets in order to understand how much of the inequality is due to differences between members of the same subset versus between observations from different subsets. In the personal income literature, the groups have been defined in a number of ways: male vs. female, age cohorts, occupation types, race, etc. In regional applications, small areas are grouped into larger sets such that the resulting sets are spatially defined. **Add notions of connected components here and link to other chapters where appropriate.**


<!-- #region {"ein.tags": "worksheet-0", "slideshow": {"slide_type": "-"}} -->
### Regional Inequality Decompositions
One approach to incorporating spatial considerations into regional inequality extends this decompositional approach by using space to define the subgroups. This can be seen using   Theil's $T$, which we encountered previously and decomposing the index  into so called *between* and *within* regional inequality components.
<!-- #endregion -->

Applied to a collection of observations on  per capita incomes for $m$ regional economies: $y = \left( y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_m \right)$, which are 
are grouped into $\omega$ mutually exclusive regions such that $\sum_{g=1}^{\omega} m_g=m$, where $m_g$ is the number of areas
assigned to region $g$, Theil's index from above can be rewritten as: 


$$
\begin{align}
T &= \sum_{i=1}^m \left( \frac{y_i}{\sum_{i=1}^m y_i} \ln \left[ m \frac{y_i}{\sum_{i=1}^m y_i}\right] \right) \\
  &= \left[ \sum_{g=1}^{\omega} s_{g} log(\frac{m}{m_g} s_g)  \right] + \left[ \sum_{g=1}^{\omega} s_g \sum_{i \in g} s_{i,g} log(m_g s_{i,g}) \right] \\
  &= B + W \\
\end{align}
$$

where $s_g = \frac{\sum_{i \in g} y_i}{\sum_i y_i}$, and   $s_{i,g} = y_i / \sum_{i \in g} y_i$. 

The first term is the between regions inequality component, and the second is the within regions inequality component.
The within region term is a weighted average of inequality between economies belonging to the same region.
Similar to what is done above for the case of interpersonal inequality, the
estimate of the between region (group) component of the decomposition is based on
setting the incomes of all economies (individuals )belonging to a region (group) equal to that of the
regional (group) average of these per capita incomes. Now, however, intraregional
inequality between economies within the same region is explicitly considered in
the second  component.

Third, the time series patterns for the interregional components are similar for the BEA regions and state partitions of the counties. Finally, the correlation of between share and overall inequality is higher at the state level than for the BEA region level


### Intraregional inequality
We can take a closer look at the within region inequality component by dissagregating the total value from XX into that occuring within each of the 8 regions. This can be done by calculating the global Theil index on the counties belonging to a given region.

```python
region_names = ["New England",
               'Mideast', 'Great Lakes', 'Plains',
               'Southeast', 'Southwest', 'Rocky Mountain',
                'Far West']
results = []
table = []
for region in range(1, 9):
    rdf = pci_df[pci_df.Region==region]
    #rdf.plot()
    #print(region, len(pandas.unique(rdf.STATEFP)), rdf.shape[0])
    table.append([region, region_names[region-1], len(pandas.unique(rdf.STATEFP)), rdf.shape[0]])
    #results.append(pysal.explore.inequality.theil.TheilDSim(rdf[ys].values, rdf.STATEFP,999))
    
```

```python
summary = pandas.DataFrame(table)
```

```python
summary.columns = [ "Region", "Name", "States", "Counties"]
```

```python
summary
```

```python
region_names = ["New England",
               'Mideast', 'Great Lakes', 'Plains',
               'Southeast', 'Southwest', 'Rocky Mountain',
                'Far West']
results = []
table = []
for region in range(1, 9):
    rdf = pci_df[pci_df.Region==region]
    #rdf.plot()
    #print(region, len(pandas.unique(rdf.STATEFP)), rdf.shape[0])
    table.append([region, region_names[region-1], len(pandas.unique(rdf.STATEFP)), rdf.shape[0]])
    results.append(pysal.explore.inequality.theil.TheilDSim(rdf[ys].values, rdf.STATEFP,999))
    
```

```python
len(results)
```

```python
r1 = results[0]
```

```python
r1.bg_pvalue
```

```python
Tr = pandas.DataFrame([result.T for result in results]).transpose()
```

```python
Tr.head()
```

```python
Tr = Tr.rename(columns=dict([(i,name) for i,name in enumerate(region_names)]))
```

```python
pinned0 = Tr.divide(Tr.iloc[0])
```

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pinned0
markers = [ "+", "8", "^", "p", ".", ">", "1", '2']
ax = df.plot(kind='line', figsize=(15, 12))
for i, line in enumerate(ax.get_lines()):
    line.set_marker(markers[i])

# for adding legend
ax.legend(ax.get_lines(), df.columns, loc='best')
_ = ax.set_title("County Income Inequality Within BEA Regions (Relative to Year 0)")
```
Unpacking the intraregional inequality term reveals that the original decomposition of inequality into within and between regions actually masks a great deal of heterogeneity in the internal inequality dynamics across the eight regions. Put another way, the overall trend in the aggregate within region component above is an average of the trends exhibited in each of the eight regions. There are two distinct groups of regions in this regard. The first consists of regions where the inequality between counties within each region has been increasing over the sample period. This group is composed of the New England,  Mideast, Far West, and Rocky Mountains regions. The second group are those regions where intraregional inequality has remained stable, or even decreased, over time. The Great Lakes, Southeast, and Southwest regions compose this group. The one outlier region is the Plains which does not fall neatly into either of these two groups.


### Regional Inequality Between States

We can also ask if there is spatial heterogeneity in the inequality between counties from different states across each of the eight regions. That is, do states matter more in different regions?

```python
bs =  numpy.array([ r.bg[0]/ r.T for r in results]).T
```

```python
bs.shape
```

```python
bs_df = pandas.DataFrame(bs, columns=region_names)
```

```python
import pandas as pd


markers = [ "+", "8", "^", "p", ".", ">", "1", '2']
ax = bs_df.plot(kind='line', figsize=(15, 12))
for i, line in enumerate(ax.get_lines()):
    line.set_marker(markers[i])

# for adding legend
ax.legend(ax.get_lines(), df.columns, loc='best')
_ = ax.set_title("Between State Inequality as a Share of Intraregional Inequality")
```
In general terms, there is much more similarity across the regions in terms of inequality between the states. The between state share of inequality is the smaller component of inequality between the counties within each of the regions with the exception of the New England region.

### Spatializing Classic Measures
<!-- #endregion -->

We now turn to two newer spatial analytics that extend a selction of the classic (a-spatial) inequality measures above to introduce a spatially explicit focus.

#### Spatial Gini

The first spatial extension was introduced by [2] and is designed to consider
the role of adjacency in a decomposition of the Gini index of inequality. More
specifically, The Gini in mean  is
$$G = \frac{\sum_i \sum_j \left | x_i - x_j \right|}{2 n^2 \bar{x}} $$
and the spatial decomposition focuses on the numerator
$$
\sum_i \sum_j \left |x_i - x_j \right | = \sum_i \sum_j \left( w_{i,j} \left |x_i - x_j \right | \right ) + \left( (1-w_{i,j})  \left |x_i - x_j \right | \right )
$$
where $w_{i,j}$ is an element of a binary spatial weights matrix indicating if observations $i$ and $j$ are spatial neighbors. This results in

$$G = \frac{\sum_i \sum_j w_{i,j}\left | x_i - x_j \right|}{2 n^2 \bar{x}} +   \frac{\sum_i \sum_j \left (1-w_{i,j} )| x_i - x_j \right|}{2 n^2 \bar{x}}. $$

The spatial Iini allows for a consideration of the spatial dependence in inequality. As this dependence increases, the second term of the spatial Gini can be expected to grow relative to the case where incomes are randomly distributed in space. Inference on the spatial Gini can be based on random spatial permutations of the income values, as we have seen elsewhere in this book.


The spatial Gini also provides a useful complement to the regional decomposition used in the Theil statistic. The latter does not consider pair-wise relationships between observations, while the spatial Gini does.

```python
from inequality.gini import Gini_Spatial
```

```python
wq.transform = 'B'
```

The spatial Gini takes a vector of incomes and a spatial weights object:

```python
gs69 = Gini_Spatial(pci_df['1969'], wq)
```

```python
gs69.g
```

```python
gs69.p_sim
```

The value is statistically significant for 1969, indicating that inequality between neighboring pairs of counties is different from the inequality between county paris that are not geographically proximate.

We can apply the same statistic over each year in the sample:

```python
gs = [Gini_Spatial(pci_df[y], wq) for y in ys]
```

```python
gs_array = np.array([(gsi.e_wcg, gsi.wcg, gsi.z_wcg, gsi.p_sim) for gsi in gs])
```

Extracting the z-values for the spatial Gini we see that the spatial dependence in the inequality is signficant in every year of the sample:

```python
res_df['z_wcg'] = gs_array[:,2]
res_df.plot(y=['z_wcg'])
```

#### Spatial 20:20
The final analytics that we examine in this notebook are based on extending the classic 20:20 ratio to develop spatial visualizations.
As was seen earlier, the 20:20 ratio measures the gap in the incomes between the counties at the 80th and 20th percentiles of the income distirbution.
In the spatial 20:20 analytic, we can visualize and measure the geographical gap (separation) between these pair of counties.

```python ein.hycell=false ein.tags="worksheet-0" jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false} slideshow={"slide_type": "-"}
ranks = pci_df.rank()
```

```python ein.hycell=false ein.tags="worksheet-0" jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false} slideshow={"slide_type": "-"}
for year in years:
    pci_df["{}_rank".format(year)] = pci_df[str(year)].rank(method='first')
```


```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
ridx_20 = int(.2 * 3077)
ridx_80 = int(.8 * 3077)
ridx_20, ridx_80
```

```python
df = pci_df
```

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
df['1969_rank']
```

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
df.index[df['1969_rank']==615].tolist()
```

```python ein.hycell=false ein.tags="worksheet-0" jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false} slideshow={"slide_type": "-"}
idx_20 = []
idx_80 = []
for year in years:
    column = "{}_rank".format(year)
    idx_20_i = df.index[df[column]==ridx_20]
    idx_20.extend(idx_20_i)
    idx_80_i = df.index[df[column]==ridx_80]
    idx_80.extend(idx_80_i)
```

As an example of the spatial 20:20 view, we plot the pair of counties at the 20th and 80th percentile for the last period of the sample:

```python ein.hycell=false ein.tags="worksheet-0" jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false} slideshow={"slide_type": "-"}
df.loc[[idx_20[-1], idx_80[-1]], :].plot()
```

Because we will be interested in measuring the spatial separation between the 20:20 counties each period, we set the coordinate reference system:

```python ein.hycell=false ein.tags="worksheet-0" jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false} slideshow={"slide_type": "-"}
import geopandas as gpd
from shapely.geometry import Point,Polygon
geom=[Point(xy) for xy in zip([117.454361,117.459880],[38.8459879,38.846255])]
ldf=gpd.GeoDataFrame(geometry=geom,crs={'init':'epsg:4326'})
ldf.to_crs(epsg=3310,inplace=True)
l=gdf.distance(ldf.shift())
```

```python ein.hycell=false ein.tags="worksheet-0" jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false} slideshow={"slide_type": "-"}
ldf = df.to_crs({'init':'epsg:4326'})
```

```python ein.hycell=false ein.tags="worksheet-0" jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false} slideshow={"slide_type": "-"}
ldf.loc[[idx_20[-1], idx_80[-1]], :].plot()
```

```python ein.hycell=false ein.tags="worksheet-0" jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false} slideshow={"slide_type": "-"}
ldf.to_crs(epsg=3310,inplace=True)

```

```python ein.hycell=false ein.tags="worksheet-0" jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false} slideshow={"slide_type": "-"}
ldf.loc[[idx_20[-1], idx_80[-1]], :].plot()
```

```python ein.hycell=false ein.tags="worksheet-0" jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false} slideshow={"slide_type": "-"}
small = ldf.loc[[idx_20[-1], idx_80[-1]], :]
```

```python ein.hycell=false ein.tags="worksheet-0" jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false} slideshow={"slide_type": "-"}
small
```

```python ein.hycell=false ein.tags="worksheet-0" jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false} slideshow={"slide_type": "-"}
small.distance(small.shift()).values[-1]
```

```python ein.hycell=false ein.tags="worksheet-0" jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false} slideshow={"slide_type": "-"}
small.geometry.centroid
```

```python ein.hycell=false ein.tags="worksheet-0" jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false} slideshow={"slide_type": "-"}
idxs = zip(idx_20, idx_80)
distances = []
for idx in idxs:
    o,d = idx
    #print(o,d, idx)
    pair = df.loc[idx, :]
    d = pair.distance(pair.shift()).values[-1]
    distances.append(d)
```

Visualizing the  plot the of the 20:20 distances, reveals a secular decline in the distances separating these pair of counties over time:

```python ein.hycell=false ein.tags="worksheet-0" jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false} slideshow={"slide_type": "-"}
idxs = zip(idx_20, idx_80)

len(distances), len(years), len(list(idxs))
gini_df['s_dist'] = numpy.array(distances)
```


```python ein.hycell=false ein.tags="worksheet-0" jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false} slideshow={"slide_type": "-"}
gini_df.plot(y=["s_dist"])
```

## Rank paths
A final analytic that we use to examine the spatial distribution of inequality across US counties is the evolution of the rank paths for the 20:20 ratio.
The rank path traces out the migration of a particular rank in the county income distribution over time [3]. To construct the rank paths for the 20:20 counties, we first plot the centroids:
<!-- #endregion -->

```python ein.tags="worksheet-0" jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false} slideshow={"slide_type": "-"}
idxs = numpy.array(list(zip(idx_20, idx_80)))
```


```python ein.hycell=false ein.tags="worksheet-0" jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false} slideshow={"slide_type": "-"}

fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, sharex='col', sharey='row')
df.loc[idxs[:,0],:].centroid.plot(ax=ax, color='r')
df.loc[idxs[:,1],:].centroid.plot(ax=ax, color='b')
ax.set_axis_off()
```



```python ein.hycell=false ein.tags="worksheet-0" jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false} slideshow={"slide_type": "-"}

fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, sharex='col', sharey='row')
df.loc[idxs[:,0],:].centroid.plot(ax=ax, color='r')
df.loc[idxs[:,1],:].centroid.plot(ax=ax, color='b')
gdf.plot(ax=ax,edgecolor='gray', alpha=0.2)
ax.set_axis_off()
```
<!-- #region {"ein.tags": "worksheet-0", "slideshow": {"slide_type": "-"}} -->
Next, a directed edge connects the centroids of the two states that held a specific rank in a pair of consecutive periods.  
<!-- #endregion -->



```python ein.hycell=false ein.tags="worksheet-0" jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false} slideshow={"slide_type": "-"}
from shapely.geometry import LineString
```

```python ein.hycell=false ein.tags="worksheet-0" jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false} slideshow={"slide_type": "-"}
ls20 = geopandas.GeoSeries(LineString(df.loc[idxs[:,0],:].centroid.tolist()))
ls80 = geopandas.GeoSeries(LineString(df.loc[idxs[:,1],:].centroid.tolist()))
```

```python ein.hycell=false ein.tags="worksheet-0" jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false} slideshow={"slide_type": "-"}

fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, sharex='col', sharey='row')
ls20.plot(ax=ax, color='r', label='20p')
ls80.plot(ax=ax, color='b')
#gdf.plot(ax=ax,edgecolor='gray', alpha=0.2)
plt.title('Rank Paths (80pct Blue, 20pct Red)')
ax.set_axis_off()
```
The rank paths can also be constructed using a moving temporal window to provide a view of the evolution of the rank migrations over subsets of the sample period. Here we do so using a window of five years:

```python ein.hycell=false ein.tags="worksheet-0" jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false} slideshow={"slide_type": "-"}
columns = 4
rows = 12
fig, ax_array = plt.subplots(rows, columns, squeeze=False, figsize=(15,15), constrained_layout=True)
year=0
for i,ax_row in enumerate(ax_array):
    for j,axes in enumerate(ax_row):
        axes.set_title('{}-{}'.format(1969+year, 1969+year+5))
        axes.set_yticklabels([])
        axes.set_xticklabels([])
        if year < 43:
            ls20 = geopandas.GeoSeries(LineString(df.loc[idxs[:,0],:].centroid.tolist()[year:year+5]))
            ls20.plot(ax=axes, color='r', label='20p')
            ls80 = geopandas.GeoSeries(LineString(df.loc[idxs[:,1],:].centroid.tolist()[year:year+5]))
            ls80.plot(ax=axes, color='b', label='20p')
    
        year += 1
plt.show()
```


Overall, there is a general north-south split for the 20 and 80 rank paths, with the wealthier part of the distribution being located more often in the northern section of the country.
